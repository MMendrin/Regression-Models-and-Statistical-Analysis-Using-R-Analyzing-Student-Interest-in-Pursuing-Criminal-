# Student Perceptions of Law Enforcement & Victimization: Regression Models and Statistical Analysis Using R
M. Mendrin

The models and analysis discussed in this project focus on the data procured from the Criminology Annual Survey on Perceptions of Law Enforcement & Victimization.  As the study seeks to determine the attitudes of students towards law enforcement and how such attitudes may relate to their experiences and perspectives regarding criminal justice and criminal justice careers, such topics will be analyzed to provide further understanding.

### This project includes an R-Script file, a PDF report of the project details, as well as a Powerpoint presentation summarizing the project method and results.

Various questions will be asked and addressed in this project: 

1) In the Just-World & Sexism Scales, there are several sets of survey questions that may potentially act as factors associated with students’ attitudes towards police, with these sets of questions listed below. Which of these factors are associated with a student’s attitude towards police?

-Global Belief in a Just World Scale (GBJW 1-7) <br />
-Hostile Sexism Towards Women (ASI 1-6) <br />
Benevolent Sexism Towards Women (ASI 7-12) <br />
Hostile Sexism Towards Men (AMI 1-6) <br />
Benevolent Sexism Towards Men (AMI 7-12) <br />

2) Considering the same factors as previously mentioned, are any of these factors related to whether a student wants to pursue a criminal justice career (CJCareerInterest)?

3) Does student attitude toward police correlate to the type of criminal justice career a student choses?

4) Are the survey questions for attitude towards police (APLS) a part of the same factor (in factor analysis) as the questions in Helping Police (HelpPolice) and Helping Legal System (HelpCJS)? 

5) Using exploratory factor analysis, how many factors do the appendices D,E, and F correspond to?
